<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Hackathon and Coding Club is the official Hackathon and Coding club of `BIT SINDRI` initially started with the motto of inculcating and improving collaborative coding culture in our collage.

Not just a club ,it is a society for collborative software development.

Now lets's hit back to the history of HnCC,

"We saw a notice in 2018 that called for people interested in programming to start a club for coders." This initiative was led by the `2k16 batch`.They were a small group of peoplebut determined to make a society that would lead by example in building the coding culture.They started building base of Dev-Society `Currently HnCC` which is not a club initially,it started as a collaborative society which is open to all interested in coding.

With limited resources, they managed to guide us in `leadership` ,`projects`, `managing events`, `conducting classes`, and the 1st and only proper hackathon `Hackatron` ever held in BIT SINDRI.It seems impossible when we look back but it did happen.We managed to establish an organization because of them we are all set to make it graet.
