Hello everyone, ***I am Anjali from 2k19,Chemical Engineering***, not exactly.....
I started my journey to the world of tech only after getting indulged in HnCC. To be a part of this prestigious club was a passion of mine when I am new to the college.

I am not a bit interested & satisfied with my branch and even don't know how should I move towards my goal which was also hidden in clouds, that time.

The day I got the news that `You got inducted in HnCC` it seems cloud breaking, and all things got cleared to me.

***1. Andorid Development***

During the journey I learned many things and my curiosity to learn more got its height day-by-day, I started making APIs use it in my own projects, explored the concept of `JSON Parsing`, `Volley`, `Room database`, `Firebase` and many more
Here are some popular apps that I made using the concepts learned:-

`BIT NETWORK` -> It is an open-source project made to connect `Alumni`, `Teachers `, `Non-Teachers`, `Seniors` all together via this platform, they can `post contents`, `comment`, `chat` with anyone and a much ore with superb frontend. Here are some glimpse of it.......

***2. Competitive Programming***

I am new to coding and don't know where to get started initially But Under the guidance of my seniors, I started CP, it was a bit difficult for me at that time but something comes to you after a long struggle and later on, I found myself lost in the track of CP, really it is interesting a lot and also I came to know about these who had made their way to CP, there is nothing to lag.

My Journey Of CP Would be revealed [here](https://github.com/anjali1361/Hackerrank_Solution "Solution to some problems")

***3. Backened Web Development***

Then I made Web Projects too to sharpen my knowledge of `Clouds`, `Networking`, `IP Address`, `Port` and deep-dived into it as I found it interesting a lot and in this journey, besides with I learned `Nodejs` and use of few of its packages and frameworks.
I believe anything that has been learned theoretically is not much efficient than using this knowledge to make your own projects. Here is some of my web apps which based on `Nodejs and Express` namely [EMS][EMS] & [PMS][PMS].

***4. Journey To Open Source, THE HACKTOBERFEST***

Wait, It was not all about, after all this, in starting of October, I got the real Idea behind `Open Source` & it's usage. Contributing to it I realized that this will give me the skills to present my application effectively or can say `HOW TO GET YOUR APPS TO PRODUCTION LEVEL`.

I tried to participate in each event organized in `Hacktoberfest` and made my `4PRs`, late night on October 1st, I didn't know at that time that my labor will get right back to me, and yes......`I GOT MY T-SHIRT FOR MY 4PR GOT MERGED`, not only that I got bundles of stickers and a `Dev Badge` also. I started following some experts in the field of my interest at [Dev Post][Dev Post] and started to participate in `Hackathons` and `Real World Projects`
