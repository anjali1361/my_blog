Hello everyone,I am anjali from 2k19,`Chemical Enginnering` ,not exactly.....
I started my journey to world of tech only after getting indulged in HnCC,to be a part of this prestigious club,was the passion of mine when I an new to the collage.

I am not a bit interested & satiesfied with my branch and even don't know how should I move towards my goal which was also hidden in clouds, that time.

The day I got the news that `You got inducted in HnCC`,it seems cloud breaking and all things got cleared to me.

                             
                            {% highlight ruby %}
  My Journey To Tech
{% endhighlight %}

`Andorid Development`

Initially I started as an Native Android Developer and the very first app that I made on my own is `BIT NETWORK using FIREBASE` at backened.
During the journey I learnt many things and my curiosity to learn more got it's height day-by-day, I started making APIs to use it in my own projects,explored the concept of `JSON Parsing`,`Volley`,`Room database`,`Firebase` and many more
Here is some popular apps that Imade using the concepts learnt:-

`BIT NETWORK` - It is open souce project made to connect `Alumuni` ,`Teachers `,`Non-Teachers`,`Seniors` all together via this platform, they can `post contents` ,`comment`,`chat` with anyone and a much ore with superb frontend. Here is the glimpse of it....some images

`Competitive Programming`

I am new to coding and did't know about where to get started initially But Under the guidance of my seniors,I started CP ,it was a bit difficult to me at that time but something comes to you after a long struggle and later on I found myself lost in the track of CP,really it is interesting a lot and also I came to knew about these who had made their way to CP ,there is nothing to lag behind.

My Journey Of CP Would be revealed [here][here]

`Backened Web Development`

Then I made Web Projects too to sharpen my knowledge of `Clouds`,`Networking`,`IP Addressess`,`Port` and deep dived into it as I found it interesting a lot and in this journey , in addition with I leant `Nodejs` and use of few of it's packages and frameworks.
I beleive anything that has learnt theoretically only is not much efficient than using this knowledge to make your own projects. Here is some of my web apps which based on `Nodejs and Express` namely [EMS][EMS] & [PMS][PMS].

`Journey To Open Source, THE HACKTOBERFEST`

Wait ,It was not all about ,after all this , in starting of October ,I got the real Idea behing `Open Source` & it's usage. Contributing to it I realized that this will give me the skills to present my application in an effective manner or can say `HOW TO GET YOUR APPS TO PRODUCTION LEVEL`.

I tried to participate in each event organized in `Hacktoberfest` and made my `4PRs` at late night on October 1st, I din't know at that time that my labour will get right back to me , and yes......`I GOT MY T-SHIRT FOR MY 4PR GOT MERGED`, not only that I got bundles of stickers and a `Dev Badge` also. I started following some experts in field of my interest at [Dev Post][Dev Post] and started to participate in `Hackathons` and `Real World Projects`

`And the journey continued...........`
