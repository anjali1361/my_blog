And here is the start of my `Hackathon` Journey with `Hack With CW`, an international level virtual hackathon held between 19th and 20th of December 2020, organized by `Code-Warriors`.

My first project in which I was given the opportunity to work in a five-member team, including me and this is `Team Voyager`

I learned a lot while making this project a successful one and finally we got 6th position out of the Top 12 teams.
Here is the statistics involved -
